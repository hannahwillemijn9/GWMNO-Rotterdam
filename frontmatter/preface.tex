In front of you lies my master thesis with the title: ‘Rotterdam’s Groundwater Monitoring Network: A Critical Examination of the Groundwater Monitoring Network and its Optimization Potential’. This master thesis has been written to fulfill the graduation requirements of the double degree program Transnational ecosystem-based Water Management at Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and University Duisburg-Essen, Germany. My research and writing for this thesis spanned from September 20, 2023, to April 9, 2024.
\newline
\newline
This thesis highlights the remarkable moment of submitting my master thesis on April 9 2024, when I started my initial master thesis exactly one year ago. Due to unfortunate circumstances the thesis was paused. I am very grateful I could continue the end phase of my studies at City of Rotterdam on the topic of geohydrology.
\newline
\newline
I would like to thank my in-company supervisors Bert de Doelder and Koen Geul for their guidance and support during the process. As well as the colleagues at the department of Urban Water, who supported and advised me. Besides that, external advice from CWG Engineers, Deltares, and Bewonersorganisatie Hillegersberg-Schiebroek. Lastly, Dr. Gertjan Geerling as first assessor from Radboud University Nijmegen and Deltares as well as the second assessor Dr. Ekkehard Christoffels from University Duisburg-Essen and IBC Ingenieure for their participation.
\newline
\newline
Finally, many thanks to my family and friends who supported me throughout the 2.5 years of the masters program. 
\newline
\newline
Enjoy your reading.
