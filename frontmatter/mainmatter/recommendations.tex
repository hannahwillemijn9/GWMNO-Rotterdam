\emph{TO WRITE}

Instead of only looking into hydrograph data that visualizes the 1D aspect, it is also possible to engage more into the groundwater contours ensuring that besides reconstruction and extension, the costs of measures like these are also examined. 

Port company Rotterdam desires to construct additional monitoring wells in public spaces throughout the port. Use of optimization-extension model could be useful to examine if it is of additional value to construct more monitoring wells or whether they should remain or be reduced.
